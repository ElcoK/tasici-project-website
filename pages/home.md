Critical infrastructure systems are essential for society but face growing vulnerabilities due to increasing interdependencies and climate extremes like heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. The Dutch infrastructure sector must balance these challenges alongside resource constraints, asset renewal, and societal transitions like decarbonization. TASICI develops innovative tools and strategies to address cascading risks, prioritize adaptation investments, and foster cross-sector collaboration. Focusing on two key corridors—the Greater Amsterdam Metropolitan Area and the Rhine-Alpine Rail Corridor—the project integrates technical, climate, and organizational research. By collaborating with infrastructure operators and key stakeholders, TASICI aims to enhance resilience, reliability, and sustainable infrastructure transitions.
