Society does not function without critical infrastructure systems. However, increasing interdependencies between these systems and the growing frequency of climate extremes, such as extreme rainfall events, droughts and heatwaves, have exposed significant vulnerabilities. Recent climate events across the Netherlands and Europe have underscored the urgent need for climate adaptation strategies that address these interconnected risks. Compounding these challenges, the Dutch infrastructure sector already faces resource constraints while balancing the demands of asset renewal, and societal transitions like decarbonization and digitalization.

TASICI aims to develop and implement innovative analytical models and intra- as well as inter-organizational frameworks that support coordinated, cross-sectoral responses to climate adaptation. By addressing three key gaps—understanding cascading risks, prioritizing adaptation within resource constraints, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration—TASICI seeks to provide infrastructure operators with actionable tools and strategies to address climate challenges. The project emphasizes a corridor approach, focusing on two critical case studies: the Greater Amsterdam Metropolitan Area, centered around Schiphol Airport, and the Dutch section of the Rhine-Alpine Rail Corridor. These case studies provide practical contexts to develop adaptation pathways and assess systemic vulnerabilities.

Through interdisciplinary collaboration, TASICI combines technical modeling, climate science, organizational and design research to align infrastructure strategies with societal resilience goals. The project facilitates co-creation with infrastructure operators and their stakeholders, ensuring the applicability of its outputs. By fostering knowledge exchange and aligning with national and European frameworks, TASICI paves the way for responsible climate adaptation, enhancing infrastructure reliability and economic resilience while supporting sustainable societal transitions.
